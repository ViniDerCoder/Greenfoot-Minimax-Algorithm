# GameWorld Project

This project contains implementations of two classic games: Connect Four and Tic Tac Toe. It uses the Minimax algorithm as an opponent for the player to show the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithm.

## Structure

The project is structured into several Java classes:

- [GameWorld.java](GameWorld.java): The main class that manages the game world.
- [Game.java](Game.java): A generic game class that defines common game logic.
- [ConnectFour.java](ConnectFour.java): The Connect Four game implementation.
- [TicTacToe.java](TicTacToe.java): The Tic Tac Toe game implementation.
- [Minimax.java](Minimax.java): An implementation of the Minimax algorithm for AI in the games.

## Running the Project

To run the project, you need to have Greenfoot installed on your machine. Open the project in Greenfoot and run the GameWorld scenario.
